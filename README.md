A realistic space travel mod for Minecraft forge 1.12.2  
Developed by Teenymario123


## What does it do?

This mod adds the ability for a player to build something and the turn that something into an entity that you can still build and break on and interact with blocks.  
The mod then uses it's own custom written physics engine in order to calculate movement of any craft through environmets like oceans, atmospheres and space.  
Now in order to move crafts the mod also adds in a wide collection range of propulsion methods like rocket engines, normal mechanical engines and propeller based propulsion.  


## Why does it do?


I got bored of mods like galacticraft and advancedrocketry and wanted something actually challenging and more cooler, trust me when I say that making some rocket that is comically small can fit 1 cubic meter of fuel in some small space and all on it's own fly to the moon and carry a massive landing pod aswell?  
Well in this mod I just wanted to build an actual rocket and actually fly the thing to space and into orbit like you would in real life.


## How does it do?


Well it is pretty simple to explain. You have a massive entity that will act as a kind of a chunk that you can build, break, interact and move within but this "chunk" is not bound to the normal minecraft world and can more around freely like any entity can. However this special entity has it's own physics written for it that allows things like aerodynamics, fluid dynamics, gravity and normal interactions like newtons laws. This physics engine is optimised to do only what it needs to, and do that very, VERY fast (I hope)


## Scale


The scale this mod provides is as follows: I hope that this mod allows you to make crafts of huge sizes (Something like 10s of thousands of blocks) and when it comes to distance I know for sure that there will be a total of 18 septillion lightyears of travel in all x, y and z directions. Just to understand, a total of 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 lightyears in all three axis. That is 18,446,744 Trillion lightyears for simpler measures. 


## How compatible i it with other mods?


Oh crap, here we go again. Compatibility is going to be a **H U G E** problem in the development of this mod. But hopefully I can get as much compatibility with as many mods that I can. Obviously there will be absplutely 0% compatibility with other space mods such as galacticraft and advanced rocketry.


## Why only on forge 1.12.2?


Well to say it simply, less lag. Minecraft forge 1.12.2 is the latest version of forge that you can get with the least amount of lag. It is a very popular version of minecraft for modding with a pretty good array of mods that help improve perforamance and other massive content mods. I will not be going through the hell of porting this mod to other versions of the game as this mod will be making a lot of changes to the core of minecraft all together. So porting is up to someone else who is worthy enough to spend months of their time trying to port this mod to other versions (You are more than welcome to port this mod to any version of your choosing).


## How to play with this mod?


Well to siply state it at this point, you can't at all. Wait for the mod to finish development or for an official alpha or beta release and I will make guides as soon as I can.
